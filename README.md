Instructions on how to use this repo:
1. Open git bash in the directory where you want to save the files from this repo
2. Type ``` git init ``` in bash, press enter and you should see a **.git** folder appear in the directory
3. Type ``` git remote add origin https://github.com/Pennywise881/collectors-skeleton.git ``` and press enter
4. Type ``` git fetch ``` and press enter
5. Type ``` git pull origin main ``` and press enter.

Following step 5 you should see all the files appear in your directory and then you can make changes to the files, commit and push. I would suggest creating a new branch and working on
your own branch and pushing to it. To create a new branch type ``` git checkout -b branch_name ``` you should see that you automatically switched to it. And then to switch from one existing branch to the another type ``` git checkout branch_name```
